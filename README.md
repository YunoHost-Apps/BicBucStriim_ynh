## Overview

BicBucStriim streams books, digital books. It was primarily designed to fill a gap in the functionality of NAS devices that provide access to music, videos and photos -- but not books. BicBucStriim fills this gap and provides web-based access to your e-book collection.
BicBucStriim is a simple PHP application that runs in the Apache/PHP environment provided by the NAS (or any other server). It assumes that you manage your e-book collection with Calibre. The application reads the [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/) data and publishes it in HTML form. To access the e-book catalog you simply point your ebook reader to your NAS, select one of your e-books and download it.

**Shipped version:** 1.6.5~ynh1
